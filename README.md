### Hi, I'm Angelli! 👋
#### software engineer, designer of sorts, serial book hoarder

Currently:
- 📍 Living on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh nations (Vancouver, Canada).
- 🌱 Working on ... nothing at the moment. Just vibin'.
- 💬 Learning Japanese if only to make my aging uncle laugh with my effort and spectacularly limited vocabulary.
- 📘 Reading [Crying in H Mart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54814676-crying-in-h-mart) by Michelle Zaunder and [Remember: The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54895704) by Lisa Genova.
- 🎶 Listening to ... the murder of crows asserting dominance by my second floor window? Early morning construction across the street? Faint indie pop floating in from the coffee shop down the block?
- 🍿 Binge-watching [Dimension 20](https://www.dropout.tv/dimension-20).
- ☕ Found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angellidimatulac/) – come say hi!
