### Hi, I'm Angelli! 👋
#### software engineer, design enthusiast, serial book hoarder

Currently:
- 📍 Living on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh nations (Vancouver, Canada).
- 🌱 Working on a remote monitoring and analysis system for all of the desk plants I collected over the pandemic.
- 💬 Learning Japanese if only to make my aging Japanese uncle laugh with my effort and spectacularly limited vocabulary.
- 📘 Reading... probably another book from my favourite genre of ✨*Books That Break Your Heart And Leave You Stunned And In Tears For Days*✨. (At the time of updating this, it's [All the Light We Cannot See](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see) by Anthony Doerr.)
- 🎶 Listening to [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) on the increasingly rare occasion that I have a long commute/drive.
- 🍿 Watching [Love on the Spectrum](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11904786/) and crying some more (but like good tears this time).
- ☕ Found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angellidimatulac/) – come say hi!
